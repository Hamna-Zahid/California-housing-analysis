# California Housing Analysis 🏡

This project explores the California Housing dataset using data analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning techniques. It is designed as a practical example of end-to-end data science workflow using Python and popular libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

## 📈 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Load California housing dataset
   - Handle missing values (if any)
   - Data standardization and encoding

2. **Descriptive Statistics & Visualization**  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Histograms, correlation heatmaps, scatter plots

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creation of new features from existing ones  
   - Scaling and transformation

4. **Model Preparation** *(optional extension)*  
   - Dataset ready for regression model training  
   - Potential to apply Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests
